This is an implementation of the RRTConnect algorithm as described originally here:

```
James J. Kuffner, and Steven M. LaValle. "RRT-connect: An efficient approach to single-query path planning".
IEEE Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), 2000.
```

The implementation contains the following variations from the original algorithm:

1) Greedy sampling of the goal: Every n-th iterations, sample the goal directly. This bias tree growth towards the goal.

2) Greedy 'extend': Instead of extending one 'epsilon' step towards a new sampled configuration, this implementation will make multiple 'epsilon' steps while the new extended node is not in collision and making progress towards the goal.

3) Low dispersion quasi-random sequence (Halton Sequence), for a more uniform and deterministic random sampling of the space, based on the following paper:

and Performance", 2016. https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.00023
